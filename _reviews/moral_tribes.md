# Moral Tribes

by Joshua Greene

Summary: 

Morality is nature's solution "the conflict between Me and Us" (the tragedy of the commons) in a tribe allowing us to put "us" ahead of "me". However, morality can not help us in solving "the conflict of Us vs Them" in an inter-tribal context. This later conflict an important challenge of our times given that we live in a time of extreme intermixing of tribes and we can not resort (and we should not resort) to "the good old way" of closing ourselves in our little tribe and throwing stones at the others. However, our brains are wired for triablism, so what is to be done?

The way morality solves the "me vs. us" dilemma is via emotional responses that warn us when we're about to do something that is against the rules of the tribe. With a (too extended maybe?) series of discussions about the trolley dilemma (trolleyology), we see that our morality is an automated but not so complicated mechanism, which is not always "rational", i.e. it generates different emotional responses for the same global outcome. E.g., we do not want to pysically push a person on the tracks to save five others, but we are much easier to accept the same sacrifice if we only have to flip a switch that will derail the train from a track with five to a track with one. Quite a few chapters are dedicated to exploring variations of the trolley dilema, and to the attempt of elucidating the brain mechanisms that explain the way our moral judgements work. A fascinating model is derived which explains why we are much more capable of reacting emotionally to the harm that we do while planning a direct action than the harm that gets done as a side effect of our planning our primary action or the harm done by our inaction. The model describes a "moral arbiter circuit" in our brain that is always checking the main action path of a plan for harm; secondary paths and alternative paths are not checked because that would be too time-consuming and often moral judgements have to be done quickly. 


All throughout these trolleyology examples, the blind spots of moral judgements are pittied against a rational, pragmatic, utilitarian ethic: everything else being equal, we'd prefer the happiness of five people vs. that of one single person. Indeed, utilitarianism seems to aim to "maximize" the happiness of everybody in a way in which every individual's happiness weighs equally in the process. 

The book continues into arguing that we can solve the "us vs them" problem also by appealing to utilitarianism and switching from our knee-jerk moral reactions to a deeply pragmatic approach to solving inter-tribe problems in which we leave asides the individually tribal morals and aim to find solutions to the problems that the tribes disagree on by trying to maximize the common good. One good observation there is that as member of a tribe, you can't argue with another tribe by appealing to your tribal moral authority (e.g. a christian should not lobby for laws against abortion because it's a sin against God; given that the God is not recognized by the secular society, other arguments must be made if the problem is really considered important).


This is the part that's least convincing because it is still not clear, given the complexity of the world, how one could "maximize" happines. I see how this is coming from a place of good intentions; and I see how indeed this is a great goal. However, I still think that the "maximizing" of the happiness for a large number of people for the long term is not as easy a task as the author wants it to be. It sounds nice, and it clearly comes from a place of good intentions, but this is the weakest part of the book. There is a little bit of a case study argument for utilitarianism: slavery, in which indeed, we see that a certain "calculus of happiness" would deduce that slavery is a bad thing. However, one example does not a theory prove. 

 
Overall it's a thought provoking book but it's long. The chapters on troleyology are especially detailed and the variations of the experiment become at some point tedious. However, I guess it's the main research domain of the auhor and he probably felt compelled to share. The fact that on my


## Notes:

- Tajfel's experiment showing that we sort people into us and them on the most arbitray of criteria
- "We are here because our morally minded ancestors outcompeted their less morally minded neigbors"
- "All cooperative groups must protect themselves from exploitation. This requires the ability to distinguish Us from Them, and the tendency to favor Us over Them. There are no human societies in which this is the norm, and for good reason. Such a society would be an open-access resource pump, waiting to shower its treasures upon any strangers who arrive at its doorstep"
- "To ferret out Ephraimite refugees, the Gileadite guards employed a simple test: They asked travelers seeking passage to pronounce the Hebrew word shibboleth. (The word refers to the grain-bearing part of a plant.) The ancient Ephraimite dialect had no sh sound, making it hard for Ephraimites to pronounce this word."
- “Kant’s categorical imperative, which he famously summarized thus:
Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or that of another, always as an end and never as a means only.”
- “Healthy people quickly develop negative responses to the bad decks, as revealed in their sweaty palms* as they reach for those decks. Rather amazingly, people start to sweat in response to the bad decks before they are consciously aware that the bad decks are bad.”
- “Because people on opposite sides of a religiously fraught moral disagreement are unlikely to agree on which texts, passages, and interpretations are authoritative, appeals to scripture are unlikely to settle all but the most narrow and scholarly moral disagreements. Thus, we have to decide which interpretations of which passages in which texts from which religious traditions are truly authoritative.”
- “the experiment in which opponents and proponents of the death penalty were shown mixed evidence concerning its efficacy as a deterrent. Instead of becoming more moderate (“the evidence is mixed”), people became more polarized. People latched on to the evidence that suited them and dismissed the rest.”
- “They asked people to explain in detail how these policies are supposed to work. Finally, they asked people to once again offer their opinions and rate their understanding. They found that people, after being forced to explain the mechanics of these policies, downgraded their estimates of their own understanding and became more moderate in their opinions. The experimenters ran a control version of this experiment in which people, instead of explaining how the policies are supposed to work, offered reasons for their opinions. For most people, offering reasons left their strong opinions intact.”
- “As Dutton and Aron predicted, the men on the wobbly bridge mistook their thumping hearts and sweaty palms for feelings of intense attraction. ”
